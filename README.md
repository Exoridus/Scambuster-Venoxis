## Getting Started

This addon packages realm data on scammers to be used with the [Scambuster](https://github.com/hypernormalisation/Scambuster) addon framework.
As such, it requires both addons to work. Once you install [Scambuster-Venoxis](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/scambuster-venoxis) alongside [Scambuster](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/scambuster), the game will alert you in real-time whenever you encounter a scammer.
To access the configuration options type `/scambuster` into the chat panel or open it via the interface addon menu.
