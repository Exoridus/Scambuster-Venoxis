# Scambuster-Venoxis

This addon packages realm data of known scammers and inappropriate players on Venoxis using the [Scambuster](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/scambuster) addon framework.

Once you install this addon alongside Scambuster, the game will alert you in real-time whenever you encounter a scammer and prints a list of all reported incidents of that player inside the chat panel.

To access the configuration options simply type `/scambuster` or `/sb` into the chat panel. Scambuster-Venoxis also provides a set of helpful commands, which can be accessed by typing `/venoxis` into the chat panel.
